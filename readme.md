# Articulate Developer Challenge

This app is my version of the "Knowledge Check Block"

## Get Started

* Pull down the code: `git clone git@github.com:stefholbrook/articulate-dev.git`

* Get it running 🏍 `npm start`

* Go ahead. Take a look 👀 visit `localhost:3000`

## Things to visit

* Border transition on the selection
* Figure out why the dot when a choice is selected moves around 😓
* Tests
* Visit server side rendering of styles (because it would be fun!)
